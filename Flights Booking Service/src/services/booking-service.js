/*
We need to execute the same logic as cancelBooking() after 
every 5-10 mins to check for bookings whose sessions are 
already expired and can never be booked by the respected 
users. So all the seats occupied by those bookings should 
be set free so that other users can book those seats.

The task cancelBooking() must be executed periodically after
a certain interval. We can use a timer using setTimeInterval()
to execute that after every 5-10 minutes. There is a problem
with that if the server is down for some time then those
changes/cancellations were not gonna work.

To handle this kind of case we have CRON JOBS

Cron jobs are scheduled at recurring intervals, specified 
using a format based on unix-cron. You can define a schedule
so that your job runs multiple times a day, or runs on 
specific days and months.

We will use a package called node-cron.
